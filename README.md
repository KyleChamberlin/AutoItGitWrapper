I use AutoIt all the time. I like to use Git to version the scripts that I write. SVN is supported in SciTE .. GIT is not. Hopefully this project will change all that. Our goals are to:


[] To get somthing similar to what SciTE does now with SVN. Commiting to a Repo and maybe diffs on previous versions.

[] Make it easy and seemless to use

[] Make more GIT functionality avaliable as needed. (Create a new Git repo, browse a repo, etc)

These maybe a touch ambitous and you are more then welcome to contribute, criticize, and test what I have here. Hopefully if you use AutoIt and Git it will help in the end.
